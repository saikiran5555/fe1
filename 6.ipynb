    "When developing a predictive model for customer churn in a telecom company using the Filter Method for feature selection, the primary goal is to identify the most relevant attributes that influence churn. Here's a step-by-step approach to accomplish this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Understand the Business Context: First, gain a deep understanding of the factors that typically influence customer churn in the telecom industry. This might include factors like service quality, pricing, customer support, plan features, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Data Exploration: Perform a preliminary analysis of the dataset. Look at the data types (categorical, numerical), check for missing values, and understand the basic characteristics of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Univariate Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "For numerical features, use statistical measures like correlation coefficients (Pearson’s, Spearman's) to determine the linear relationship between each feature and the target variable (churn).\n",
    "For categorical features, use tests like the chi-squared test or measures like mutual information to evaluate the dependency between each feature and the target variable.\n",
    "Rank Features: Based on the results of these statistical tests, rank the features in order of their relevance or impact on the churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multivariate Analysis (if applicable): While the Filter Method primarily focuses on univariate analysis, considering some form of multivariate analysis can be beneficial. For instance, you can check for multicollinearity among features to ensure that highly correlated predictors are not redundantly included.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: Choose the top features based on their scores from the statistical tests. The number of features selected can depend on the model complexity you’re willing to handle and the performance trade-offs you are ready to make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterative Process: Feature selection is often an iterative process. After selecting features, build a preliminary model to test their predictive power. Based on the model’s performance, you may decide to adjust the number of features or reconsider certain attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain Expert Consultation: Collaborate with domain experts to validate the selected features. Their insights are crucial as they can provide practical context to the statistical findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finalize Feature Set: Based on the statistical analysis, model performance, and expert feedback, finalize the set of features to be used in the churn prediction model."
