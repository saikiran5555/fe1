    "Using the Wrapper method for feature selection in a house price prediction project involves an iterative process where different combinations of features are evaluated based on the performance of a specific predictive model. Here’s how you would implement this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose a Predictive Model: First, select a predictive model to use. This could be a linear regression model, a decision tree, or any other suitable model for predicting house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Evaluation Criteria: Establish a criterion to evaluate the model's performance, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared, etc. This metric will be used to assess how well the model performs with different subsets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Feature Set: Start with an initial set of features (size, location, age, etc.). You may begin with all available features, a single feature, or a subset based on domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Subset Selection Strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forward Selection: Start with no (or minimal) features and iteratively add one feature at a time. At each step, choose the feature that, when added, results in the greatest improvement in model performance.\n",
    "Backward Elimination: Start with all available features and iteratively remove one feature at a time. At each step, drop the feature that, when removed, causes the least decrease in model performance.\n",
    "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): This is a hybrid approach where features are recursively removed and the model is rebuilt at each step.\n",
    "Iterative Evaluation: For each iteration, train the model using the selected subset of features and evaluate its performance using the chosen metric. The idea is to find the subset that offers the best performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation: To ensure that the model isn’t overfitting to the training data, use cross-validation. This involves splitting the dataset into several subsets and validating the model performance on each subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Determine the Optimal Feature Set: After iterating through different combinations, determine the set of features that yielded the best performance based on the evaluation criteria. This set is considered the optimal subset of features for your predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Model Training: Train the final model using the selected feature subset on the entire dataset to maximize its predictive ability."
